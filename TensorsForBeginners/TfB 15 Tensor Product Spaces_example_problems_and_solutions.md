# TfB 15 Tensor Product Spaces: Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1
If $V$ is a 3-dimensional vector space and $W$ is a 4-dimensional vector space, what is the dimension of their tensor product space $V \otimes W$?

## Solution 1
The dimension of the tensor product space is the product of the dimensions of the individual spaces: $\dim(V \otimes W) = \dim(V) \cdot \dim(W) = 3 \cdot 4 = 12$.

## Problem 2
If $\{\mathbf{e_1}, \mathbf{e_2}\}$ is a basis for $V$ and $\{\mathbf{f_1}, \mathbf{f_2}\}$ is a basis for $W$, write down a basis for $V \otimes W$.

## Solution 2
A basis for $V \otimes W$ is given by the tensor products of the basis vectors of $V$ and $W$:
$$\{\mathbf{e_1} \otimes \mathbf{f_1}, \mathbf{e_1} \otimes \mathbf{f_2}, \mathbf{e_2} \otimes \mathbf{f_1}, \mathbf{e_2} \otimes \mathbf{f_2}\}$$
