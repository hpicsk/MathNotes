# TfB 14 Tensors are General Vector Covector Combinations: Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1
Construct a (1, 2) tensor by taking the tensor product of a vector $\mathbf{v} = (1, 2)$, a covector $\mathbf{f} = (3, 4)$, and a covector $\mathbf{g} = (5, 6)$.

## Solution 1
The tensor $T$ is given by $T = \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{f} \otimes \mathbf{g}$. Its components are $T^i_{jk} = v^i \cdot f_j \cdot g_k$.

## Problem 2
Given a (2, 1) tensor, how can you decompose it into a sum of tensor products of vectors and covectors?

## Solution 2
A (2, 1) tensor $T$ can be written as a sum of tensor products of two vectors and one covector: $T = \sum_t (\mathbf{v}_t \otimes \mathbf{w}_t \otimes \mathbf{f}_t)$.
