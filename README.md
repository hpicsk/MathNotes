# Math Notes

## Why?

I really admire eigenchris's theoretical physic lecture, but found myself hard to grasp since only abstract concepts are presented one after another. Thought that it might help if example problems were presented. The problems are generated by gemini-cli and claude-cli.

## Generating Problems

If you want to generate the problems yourself, I recommend using the following prompt:

```
I'm having problems understanding this topic because it only presents concepts. Give me some concrete example problem sets for this lecture. Give the solutions to the example problems.

Both the problems and solutions should be presented in same file, one after the other:
problem 1 -> solution 1 -> problem 2 -> solution 2 -> ...

All mathematical expressions should be in latex format for better readability.
When subproblems are given, they should be presented with new line.
Make for each pptx lecture files and save it as {filename}_example_problems_and_solutions.md
```

Then check again with this prompt:

```
I made example problems and solutions as md file. Iterate through each. Check for any errors in the problems and the solutions.

Check any latex compile errors. Fix it.
```

## Error Reporting

Because the problems and solutions were generated by LLMs, errors or incorrect arguments may be present. If you find any mistakes, feel free to report them.
