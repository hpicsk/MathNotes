# How Gravitational Waves Affect Free Particles - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

How does a gravitational wave affect a ring of free particles?

## Solution 1

A gravitational wave causes a tidal deformation of spacetime. A ring of free particles will be stretched and squeezed as the gravitational wave passes. For a plus-polarized wave, the ring will be stretched in one direction and squeezed in the perpendicular direction. For a cross-polarized wave, the ring will be deformed into a rotating ellipse.

## Problem 2

What is the strain of a gravitational wave?

## Solution 2

The strain of a gravitational wave is a measure of the amplitude of the wave. It is defined as the fractional change in the distance between two free particles:

$$h = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$

## Problem 3

A gravitational wave with a certain strain passes through a detector. How does the detector measure the strain?

## Solution 3

A gravitational wave detector, such as LIGO, is a Michelson interferometer. A gravitational wave will cause a change in the length of the two arms of the interferometer. This change in length will cause a change in the interference pattern, which can be detected. The strain of the gravitational wave can be calculated from the change in the interference pattern.
