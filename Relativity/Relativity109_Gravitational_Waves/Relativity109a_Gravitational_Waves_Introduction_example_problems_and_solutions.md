# Gravitational Waves Introduction - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

What are gravitational waves?

## Solution 1

Gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source. They were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 on the basis of his theory of general relativity.

## Problem 2

How are gravitational waves generated?

## Solution 2

Gravitational waves are generated by accelerating masses. Some of the most powerful sources of gravitational waves are binary systems of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes.

## Problem 3

What is the evidence for the existence of gravitational waves?

## Solution 3

The first direct evidence for the existence of gravitational waves was the observation of the binary pulsar system PSR B1913+16 by Hulse and Taylor in 1974. The observed decrease in the orbital period of the binary system was consistent with the energy loss due to the emission of gravitational waves. The first direct detection of gravitational waves was made in 2015 by the LIGO experiment, which detected the gravitational waves from the merger of two black holes.
