# FLRW Metric - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

What is the FLRW metric? What are its assumptions?

## Solution 1

The Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric is an exact solution of the Einstein field equations of general relativity. It describes a homogeneous, isotropic, expanding or contracting universe. The metric is:

$$ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 \left[\frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2} + r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2)\right]$$

The assumptions are that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales.

## Problem 2

What is the scale factor $a(t)$? What does it represent?

## Solution 2

The scale factor $a(t)$ represents the relative expansion of the universe as a function of time. It is normalized so that $a(t_0) = 1$ at the present time.

## Problem 3

What are the three possible geometries of the universe in the FLRW model?

## Solution 3

The parameter $k$ in the FLRW metric determines the geometry of the universe.

- $k = 1$: closed universe with positive curvature (spherical geometry).
- $k = 0$: flat universe with zero curvature (Euclidean geometry).
- $k = -1$: open universe with negative curvature (hyperbolic geometry).
