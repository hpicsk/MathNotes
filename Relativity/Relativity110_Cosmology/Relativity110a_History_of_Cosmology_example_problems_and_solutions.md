# History of Cosmology - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

Describe the geocentric and heliocentric models of the universe.

## Solution 1

The geocentric model, proposed by Ptolemy, is a model of the universe in which the Earth is at the center. The heliocentric model, proposed by Copernicus, is a model of the universe in which the Sun is at the center.

## Problem 2

What was the contribution of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler to the development of cosmology?

## Solution 2

- Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model of the universe.
- Galileo's observations with a telescope, such as the phases of Venus and the moons of Jupiter, provided evidence for the heliocentric model.
- Kepler's laws of planetary motion described the orbits of the planets as ellipses, with the Sun at one focus.

## Problem 3

What is Olbers' paradox? How is it resolved?

## Solution 3

Olbers' paradox is the argument that the darkness of the night sky conflicts with the assumption of an infinite and eternal static universe. If the universe were infinite, static, and uniformly filled with stars, then every line of sight should end on the surface of a star, and the night sky should be as bright as the surface of a star. The paradox is resolved by the fact that the universe is not static, but is expanding, and has a finite age.
