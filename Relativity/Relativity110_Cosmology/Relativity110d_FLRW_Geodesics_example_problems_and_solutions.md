# FLRW Geodesics - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

Derive the geodesic equations for the FLRW metric.

## Solution 1

The geodesic equations for the FLRW metric can be derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations. For a massive particle, the geodesic equations are:

$$\frac{d}{d\tau} \left(a^2 \frac{dr}{d\tau}\right) - a^2 r \left(\frac{d\theta}{d\tau}\right)^2 - a^2 r \sin^2\theta \left(\frac{d\phi}{d\tau}\right)^2 = 0$$

$$\frac{d}{d\tau} \left(a^2 r^2 \frac{d\theta}{d\tau}\right) - a^2 r^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta \left(\frac{d\phi}{d\tau}\right)^2 = 0$$

$$\frac{d}{d\tau} \left(a^2 r^2 \sin^2\theta \frac{d\phi}{d\tau}\right) = 0$$

$$\frac{d}{d\tau} \left(c^2 \frac{dt}{d\tau}\right) + \frac{a\dot{a}}{1-kr^2} \left(\frac{dr}{d\tau}\right)^2 + a\dot{a}r^2 \left(\frac{d\theta}{d\tau}\right)^2 + a\dot{a}r^2\sin^2\theta \left(\frac{d\phi}{d\tau}\right)^2 = 0$$

## Problem 2

What is cosmological redshift? How is it related to the scale factor?

## Solution 2

Cosmological redshift is the redshift of light from distant galaxies, which is caused by the expansion of the universe. The redshift $z$ is related to the scale factor $a(t)$ by:

$$1 + z = \frac{a(t_0)}{a(t_e)}$$

where $t_0$ is the time of observation and $t_e$ is the time of emission.

## Problem 3

What is the particle horizon? What is the event horizon?

## Solution 3

The particle horizon is the maximum distance from which particles could have traveled to the observer in the age of the universe.

The event horizon is the boundary of the region of spacetime from which events can affect a future observer.
