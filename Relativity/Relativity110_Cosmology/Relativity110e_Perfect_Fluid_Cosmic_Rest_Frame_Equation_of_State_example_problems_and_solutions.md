# Perfect Fluid, Cosmic Rest Frame, and Equation of State - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

What is a perfect fluid?

## Solution 1

A perfect fluid is a fluid that has no viscosity or heat conduction. It is characterized by its energy density $\rho$ and pressure $p$.

## Problem 2

What is the cosmic rest frame?

## Solution 2

The cosmic rest frame is the coordinate system in which the cosmic microwave background radiation is isotropic.

## Problem 3

What is the equation of state of a fluid? What are the equations of state for matter, radiation, and dark energy?

## Solution 3

The equation of state of a fluid is a relation between its pressure and energy density.

- Matter: $p = 0$
- Radiation: $p = \frac{1}{3}\rho c^2$
- Dark energy: $p = -\rho c^2$
