# Special Relativity - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

A spaceship is moving at a speed of $0.8c$ relative to the Earth. A person on the spaceship measures the length of the spaceship to be $100$ m. What is the length of the spaceship as measured by an observer on the Earth?

### Solution 1

The length of the spaceship as measured by an observer on the Earth is given by the length contraction formula:

$$L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

where $L_0$ is the proper length (length measured in the rest frame of the spaceship), $v$ is the velocity of the spaceship, and $c$ is the speed of light.

$$L = 100 \text{ m} \times \sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.8c)^2}{c^2}} = 100 \text{ m} \times \sqrt{1 - 0.64} = 100 \text{ m} \times \sqrt{0.36} = 100 \text{ m} \times 0.6 = 60 \text{ m}$$

## Problem 2

A muon is an unstable particle that decays with a half-life of $2.2$ microseconds in its own rest frame. If a muon is created in the Earth's upper atmosphere and travels towards the ground at a speed of $0.99c$, what is its half-life as measured by an observer on the Earth?

### Solution 2

The half-life of the muon as measured by an observer on the Earth is given by the time dilation formula:

$$t = \frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

where $t_0$ is the proper half-life (half-life in the rest frame of the muon).

$$t = \frac{2.2 \text{ μs}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.99c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{2.2 \text{ μs}}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9801}} = \frac{2.2 \text{ μs}}{\sqrt{0.0199}} = \frac{2.2 \text{ μs}}{0.141} = 15.6 \text{ μs}$$

## Problem 3

Two spaceships are moving towards each other. Spaceship A is moving at a speed of $0.6c$ and spaceship B is moving at a speed of $0.8c$, both relative to a stationary observer. What is the relative velocity of spaceship A with respect to spaceship B?

### Solution 3

The relative velocity of spaceship A with respect to spaceship B is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

$$v_{AB} = \frac{v_A - v_B}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}$$

Let the direction of motion of spaceship A be the positive direction.

Since the spaceships are moving towards each other:
- $v_A = 0.6c$
- $v_B = -0.8c$ (negative because it's moving in the opposite direction)

$$v_{AB} = \frac{0.6c - (-0.8c)}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(-0.8c)}{c^2}} = \frac{1.4c}{1 + 0.48} = \frac{1.4c}{1.48} = 0.946c$$
