# Schwarzschild Metric Interpretation - Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

What is the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole?

## Solution 1

The event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is a boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer. It is located at the Schwarzschild radius $r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$.

## Problem 2

What is the singularity of a Schwarzschild black hole?

## Solution 2

The singularity of a Schwarzschild black hole is a point of infinite density and curvature at the center of the black hole ($r=0$).

## Problem 3

What happens to time and space coordinates near the event horizon?

## Solution 3

As an object approaches the event horizon, time appears to slow down for a distant observer. This is known as gravitational time dilation. At the event horizon, time appears to stop completely.

The radial coordinate $r$ and the time coordinate $t$ exchange their character at the event horizon. Inside the event horizon, $r$ becomes a time-like coordinate and $t$ becomes a space-like coordinate. This means that an object inside the event horizon must move towards the singularity at $r=0$.
