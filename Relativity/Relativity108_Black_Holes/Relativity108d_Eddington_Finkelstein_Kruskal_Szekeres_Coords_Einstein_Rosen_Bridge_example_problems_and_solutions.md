# Eddington-Finkelstein, Kruskal-Szekeres Coordinates and Einstein-Rosen Bridge - Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

What are Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates? How do they remove the coordinate singularity at the event horizon?

## Solution 1

Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates are a coordinate system that is adapted to radial null geodesics. They are defined by:

$$v = ct + r^* \quad \text{(ingoing)}$$

$$u = ct - r^* \quad \text{(outgoing)}$$

where $r^*$ is the tortoise coordinate:

$$r^* = r + \frac{2GM}{c^2} \ln\left|\frac{r}{2GM/c^2} - 1\right|$$

In these coordinates, the metric is regular at the event horizon, which shows that the singularity at the event horizon in Schwarzschild coordinates is a coordinate singularity.

## Problem 2

What are Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates? What is a Penrose diagram?

## Solution 2

Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates are a maximal extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime. They cover the entire spacetime, including the interior of the black hole and a white hole. The metric in Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates is regular everywhere except at the physical singularity at $r=0$.

A Penrose diagram is a conformal transformation of the spacetime diagram that brings infinity to a finite distance. It is used to visualize the causal structure of spacetime.

## Problem 3

What is an Einstein-Rosen bridge? Is it traversable?

## Solution 3

An Einstein-Rosen bridge, or a wormhole, is a hypothetical topological feature of spacetime that would be a shortcut through spacetime. The Schwarzschild solution contains an Einstein-Rosen bridge. However, it is not traversable. An observer trying to cross the bridge would be destroyed by the singularity.
