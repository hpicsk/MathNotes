# Velocity Addition and Relativity of Simultaneity - Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

A spaceship is moving at a speed of $0.5c$. It fires a missile in the forward direction with a speed of $0.5c$ relative to the spaceship. What is the speed of the missile as measured by a stationary observer?

### Solution 1

Using the velocity addition formula:
$$u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u'v/c^2}$$

$$u = \frac{0.5c + 0.5c}{1 + (0.5c)(0.5c)/c^2} = \frac{c}{1 + 0.25} = \frac{c}{1.25} = 0.8c$$

## Problem 2

Two events are simultaneous in a frame $S$. Are they simultaneous in a frame $S'$ moving with respect to $S$?

### Solution 2

No, two events that are simultaneous in a frame $S$ are not necessarily simultaneous in a frame $S'$ moving with respect to $S$.

If two events at positions $x_1$ and $x_2$ are simultaneous in $S$, then $t_1 = t_2$.

In frame $S'$, the times of the events are:
$$t_1' = \gamma (t_1 - vx_1/c^2)$$
$$t_2' = \gamma (t_2 - vx_2/c^2)$$

Since $t_1 = t_2$:
$$t_1' - t_2' = \gamma v (x_2 - x_1) / c^2$$

If $x_1 \neq x_2$, then $t_1' \neq t_2'$, so the events are not simultaneous in $S'$.

## Problem 3

Explain the concept of relativity of simultaneity with a thought experiment.

### Solution 3

Consider a train moving with a constant velocity. A light source is placed at the center of a train car. The light source emits a flash of light. For an observer on the train, the light reaches the front and back of the train car at the same time.

For an observer on the ground, the train is moving. The back of the train car is moving towards the point where the light was emitted, while the front of the train car is moving away from it. Therefore, the light reaches the back of the train car before it reaches the front.

This shows that two events that are simultaneous for an observer on the train (the light reaching the front and back of the car) are not simultaneous for an observer on the ground.
