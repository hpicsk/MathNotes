# Galilean Transformations - Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

A particle has coordinates $(t, x)$ in a stationary frame $S$. What are its coordinates $(t', x')$ in a frame $S'$ moving with velocity $v$ with respect to $S$?

## Solution 1

The Galilean transformation equations are:
$$t' = t$$
$$x' = x - vt$$

## Problem 2

The velocity of a particle in frame $S$ is $u = dx/dt$. What is its velocity $u' = dx'/dt'$ in frame $S'$?

## Solution 2

$$u' = \frac{dx'}{dt'} = \frac{d(x - vt)}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt} - v = u - v$$

## Problem 3

Show that the acceleration of a particle is invariant under a Galilean transformation.

## Solution 3

The acceleration in frame $S$ is $a = du/dt$.

The acceleration in frame $S'$ is $a' = du'/dt'$.

$$a' = \frac{d(u - v)}{dt} = \frac{du}{dt} - \frac{dv}{dt}$$

Since $v$ is a constant velocity, $dv/dt = 0$.

So, $a' = du/dt = a$.

The acceleration is invariant under a Galilean transformation.
