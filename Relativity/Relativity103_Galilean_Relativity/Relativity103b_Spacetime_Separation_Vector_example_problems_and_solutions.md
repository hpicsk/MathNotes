# Spacetime Separation Vector - Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

Two events have spacetime coordinates $(t_1, x_1)$ and $(t_2, x_2)$. Write down the spacetime separation vector between these two events.

## Solution 1

The spacetime separation vector is $\Delta s = (c(t_2 - t_1), x_2 - x_1)$.

## Problem 2

For the two events in Problem 1, what is the square of the spacetime separation?

## Solution 2

The square of the spacetime separation is $(\Delta s)^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2$. In Galilean relativity, the temporal separation and spatial separation are absolute. The spacetime separation is just the spatial separation.

## Problem 3

Under a Galilean transformation, does the spacetime separation vector change? If so, how?

## Solution 3

Yes, the spacetime separation vector changes under a Galilean transformation.

Let the transformation be $x' = x - vt$.

The new spacetime separation vector is:
$$\Delta s' = (c(t_2 - t_1), x_2' - x_1') = (c(t_2 - t_1), (x_2 - vt_2) - (x_1 - vt_1))$$

$$= (c(t_2 - t_1), (x_2 - x_1) - v(t_2 - t_1))$$

The spatial component of the separation vector changes.
