# Spacetime Diagrams - Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

Draw a spacetime diagram for a particle at rest at $x = 1$.

## Solution 1

A particle at rest at $x = 1$ is represented by a vertical line at $x = 1$ in the spacetime diagram. The time $t$ increases along the line.

## Problem 2

Draw a spacetime diagram for a particle moving with a constant velocity $v$.

## Solution 2

A particle moving with a constant velocity $v$ is represented by a straight line with a slope of $1/v$ in the spacetime diagram. The equation of the line is $x = vt + x_0$, where $x_0$ is the position of the particle at $t = 0$.

## Problem 3

Draw a spacetime diagram for two particles that start at the same position and move with different velocities.

## Solution 3

Two particles that start at the same position (let's say $x = 0$ at $t = 0$) and move with different velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ are represented by two straight lines starting from the origin with different slopes $1/v_1$ and $1/v_2$.
