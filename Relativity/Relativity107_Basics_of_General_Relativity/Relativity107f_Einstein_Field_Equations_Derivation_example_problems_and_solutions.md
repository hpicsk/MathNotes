# Einstein Field Equations Derivation - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

Starting from the Einstein-Hilbert action, derive the Einstein field equations.

## Solution 1

The Einstein-Hilbert action is:
$$S = \int R \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x$$
where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $g$ is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Varying the action with respect to the metric tensor gives the Einstein field equations:
$$R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$$

## Problem 2

What is the cosmological constant? What is its role in the Einstein field equations?

## Solution 2

The cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is a term that can be added to the Einstein field equations:
$$R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$$

The cosmological constant represents a constant energy density of the vacuum. It is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.

## Problem 3

Show that in the weak field limit, the Einstein field equations reduce to Newton's law of gravitation.

## Solution 3

In the weak field limit, the metric tensor can be written as $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}$, where $h_{\mu\nu}$ is a small perturbation.

The Einstein field equations reduce to:
$$\nabla^2 h_{00} = -\frac{16\pi G}{c^4} T_{00}$$

This is Poisson's equation for the gravitational potential, which is equivalent to Newton's law of gravitation.
