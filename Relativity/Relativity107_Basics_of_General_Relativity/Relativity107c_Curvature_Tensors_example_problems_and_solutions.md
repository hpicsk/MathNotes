# Curvature Tensors - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

What is the Riemann curvature tensor? What does it measure?

## Solution 1

The Riemann curvature tensor $R^a_{bcd}$ measures the curvature of spacetime. It is defined by the effect of parallel transporting a vector around an infinitesimal closed loop. If the vector changes after being transported around the loop, then the spacetime is curved.

## Problem 2

What is the Ricci tensor? How is it related to the Riemann tensor?

## Solution 2

The Ricci tensor $R_{ab}$ is obtained by contracting the Riemann tensor: $R_{ab} = R^c_{acb}$. The Ricci tensor describes the change in the volume of a small ball of matter.

## Problem 3

What is the Ricci scalar? How is it related to the Ricci tensor?

## Solution 3

The Ricci scalar $R$ is obtained by contracting the Ricci tensor with the inverse metric: $R = g^{ab} R_{ab}$. The Ricci scalar is a measure of the overall curvature of spacetime.
