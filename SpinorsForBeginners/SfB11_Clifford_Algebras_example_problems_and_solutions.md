# Example Problems and Solutions: Clifford Algebras

Clifford algebras are a powerful tool for geometry, unifying vectors, bivectors, and other multivectors into a single algebraic structure.

## Problem 1: The Clifford Product

The fundamental rule of a Clifford algebra is $v^2 = q(v)$ for any vector v, where q is a quadratic form.
This implies the "vector sandwich" rule: $uv + vu = 2q(u,v)$, where $q(u,v)$ is the associated symmetric bilinear form.

Let's work in 2D Euclidean space, $Cl_{2,0}$. The basis vectors are $e_1, e_2$ with $e_1^2=1, e_2^2=1, e_1e_2 = -e_2e_1$.
The algebra has basis {1, $e_1$, $e_2$, $e_1e_2$}.
Let $u = 3e_1 + 4e_2$ and $v = 5e_1 - 6e_2$.

a) Calculate the Clifford product $uv$.

b) The inner product of two vectors is the scalar part of their Clifford product: $u \cdot v = \frac{1}{2}(uv+vu)$. Calculate $u \cdot v$.

c) The outer (or wedge) product is the bivector part: $u \wedge v = \frac{1}{2}(uv-vu)$. Calculate $u \wedge v$.

d) Show that $uv = u \cdot v + u \wedge v$.

### Solution 1

a) **Calculate the Clifford product $uv$.**

$$uv = (3e_1 + 4e_2)(5e_1 - 6e_2) = 15e_1^2 - 18e_1e_2 + 20e_2e_1 - 24e_2^2$$
$$= 15 - 18e_1e_2 - 20e_1e_2 - 24 = -9 - 38e_1e_2$$

b) **Calculate $u \cdot v$.**

$$u \cdot v = \frac{1}{2}(uv+vu)$$

$$vu = (5e_1 - 6e_2)(3e_1 + 4e_2) = 15e_1^2 + 20e_1e_2 - 18e_2e_1 - 24e_2^2 = 15 + 20e_1e_2 + 18e_1e_2 - 24 = -9 + 38e_1e_2$$

$$u \cdot v = \frac{1}{2}((-9 - 38e_1e_2) + (-9 + 38e_1e_2)) = \frac{1}{2}(-18) = -9$$

Alternatively, using the standard dot product: $(3,4)\cdot(5,-6) = 15-24 = -9$.

c) **Calculate $u \wedge v$.**

$$u \wedge v = \frac{1}{2}(uv-vu) = \frac{1}{2}((-9 - 38e_1e_2) - (-9 + 38e_1e_2)) = \frac{1}{2}(-76e_1e_2) = -38e_1e_2$$

d) **Show that $uv = u \cdot v + u \wedge v$.**

$$-9 - 38e_1e_2 = -9 + (-38e_1e_2)$$

This is correct.

## Problem 2: Geometric Interpretation

The elements of a Clifford algebra have geometric interpretations.
- Scalars (Grade 0): magnitudes
- Vectors (Grade 1): oriented lengths
- Bivectors (Grade 2): oriented areas, or planes and rotations
- Trivectors (Grade 3): oriented volumes

In $Cl_{3,0}$ (3D Euclidean space), the basis is {1, $e_1$, $e_2$, $e_3$, $e_1e_2$, $e_2e_3$, $e_3e_1$, $e_1e_2e_3$}.
The element $I = e_1e_2e_3$ is the pseudoscalar.

a) Calculate $I^2$.

b) Calculate the product of a vector $e_1$ with the bivector $B = e_1e_2$. Is the result a vector?

c) The dual of a multivector A is $A^* = -AI$.
   Calculate the dual of the vector $e_1$. What kind of element is it?

d) Calculate the dual of the bivector $e_1e_2$.
   This shows that in 3D, there is a correspondence (duality) between vectors and bivectors. This is why we can use the cross product to represent rotations.

### Solution 2

a) **Calculate $I^2$.**

$$I^2 = (e_1e_2e_3)(e_1e_2e_3) = e_1e_2(e_3e_1)e_2e_3 = e_1e_2(-e_1e_3)e_2e_3 = -e_1(e_2e_1)e_3e_2e_3$$
$$= -e_1(-e_1e_2)e_3e_2e_3 = e_1^2e_2e_3e_2e_3 = e_2(e_3e_2)e_3 = e_2(-e_2e_3)e_3 = -e_2^2e_3^2 = -1$$

b) **Calculate the product of a vector $e_1$ with the bivector $B = e_1e_2$.**

$$e_1(e_1e_2) = e_1^2e_2 = e_2$$

The result is a vector.

c) **Calculate the dual of the vector $e_1$.**

$$e_1^* = -e_1I = -e_1(e_1e_2e_3) = -e_1^2e_2e_3 = -e_2e_3$$

The dual of a vector is a bivector.

d) **Calculate the dual of the bivector $e_1e_2$.**

$$(e_1e_2)^* = -(e_1e_2)I = -(e_1e_2)(e_1e_2e_3) = -(-1)e_3 = e_3$$

The dual of a bivector is a vector.

## Problem 3: Rotations

In a Clifford algebra, rotations are performed by "sandwiching" an object with an element of the Spin group (a "rotor").
A rotor is an element $R = \exp(B/2)$, where B is a bivector representing the plane of rotation.
The rotation of a vector v is $v' = R v R^{-1}$.

Let's work in $Cl_{2,0}$. The bivector for the xy-plane is $B = \theta e_1e_2$.
The rotor is $R = \exp(\theta/2 e_1e_2)$.
Note that $(e_1e_2)^2 = e_1e_2e_1e_2 = -e_1e_1e_2e_2 = -1$. So $e_1e_2$ behaves like the imaginary unit $i$.

a) Use Euler's formula to expand the rotor: $R = \cos(\theta/2) + e_1e_2 \sin(\theta/2)$.

b) What is the inverse of the rotor, $R^{-1}$?

c) Let $v = e_1$. Calculate the rotated vector $v' = R e_1 R^{-1}$ for a rotation angle of $\theta$.
   (Hint: you will need to use the anti-commutation rules, e.g. $e_1(e_1e_2) = e_2$).

d) Verify that the result is $v' = (\cos\theta)e_1 + (\sin\theta)e_2$, as expected.

### Solution 3

a) **Use Euler's formula to expand the rotor: $R = \cos(\theta/2) + e_1e_2 \sin(\theta/2)$.**

This is the correct expansion, since $(e_1e_2)^2 = -1$.

b) **What is the inverse of the rotor, $R^{-1}$?**

$$R^{-1} = \exp(-\theta/2 e_1e_2) = \cos(\theta/2) - e_1e_2 \sin(\theta/2)$$

c) **Let $v = e_1$. Calculate the rotated vector $v' = R e_1 R^{-1}$.**

$$v' = (\cos(\theta/2) + e_1e_2 \sin(\theta/2)) e_1 (\cos(\theta/2) - e_1e_2 \sin(\theta/2))$$
$$= e_1(\cos^2(\theta/2) - \sin^2(\theta/2)) + e_2(2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)) = e_1\cos\theta + e_2\sin\theta$$

d) **Verify that the result is $v' = (\cos\theta)e_1 + (\sin\theta)e_2$, as expected.**

The result is verified.

## Problem 4: Spacetime Algebra (STA)

The Clifford algebra of Minkowski spacetime is $Cl_{1,3}$.
The basis vectors are {$\gamma_0, \gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3$} with $\gamma_0^2=1, \gamma_i^2=-1$ for i=1,2,3.
This is the algebra in which the Dirac equation is naturally expressed.

a) A 4-vector is $x = x^\mu \gamma_\mu$.

b) A Lorentz transformation is performed by a rotor $L \in Spin(1,3)$.
   $x' = L x L^{-1}$.
   A boost in the x-direction is represented by the rotor $L = \exp(\eta/2 \gamma_1\gamma_0)$, where $\eta$ is the rapidity.
   Note that $(\gamma_1\gamma_0)^2 = \gamma_1\gamma_0\gamma_1\gamma_0 = -\gamma_1\gamma_1\gamma_0\gamma_0 = -(-1)(1) = 1$.

c) Expand the rotor L using the property $(\gamma_1\gamma_0)^2=1$. (It will involve $\cosh$ and $\sinh$).

d) Let $x = \gamma_0$ (a vector pointing in the time direction at the origin).
   Calculate the boosted vector $x' = L \gamma_0 L^{-1}$.
   Verify that the result corresponds to the time axis of a moving observer.

### Solution 4

c) **Expand the rotor L using the property $(\gamma_1\gamma_0)^2=1$.**

$$L = \exp(\eta/2 \gamma_1\gamma_0) = \cosh(\eta/2) + \gamma_1\gamma_0 \sinh(\eta/2)$$

d) **Let $x = \gamma_0$. Calculate the boosted vector $x' = L \gamma_0 L^{-1}$.**

$$L^{-1} = \exp(-\eta/2 \gamma_1\gamma_0) = \cosh(\eta/2) - \gamma_1\gamma_0 \sinh(\eta/2)$$

$$x' = (\cosh(\eta/2) + \gamma_1\gamma_0 \sinh(\eta/2)) \gamma_0 (\cosh(\eta/2) - \gamma_1\gamma_0 \sinh(\eta/2))$$
$$= \gamma_0(\cosh^2(\eta/2)+\sinh^2(\eta/2)) + \gamma_1(2\sinh(\eta/2)\cosh(\eta/2))$$
$$= \gamma_0\cosh\eta + \gamma_1\sinh\eta$$

This is the time axis of an observer moving with rapidity $\eta$ in the x-direction.

## Problem 5: Corrected Problem

The structure of real Clifford algebras follows a pattern with periodicity 8.
The "Clifford Clock" helps visualize this.
$$Cl_{0,0} = \mathbb{R}$$
$$Cl_{0,1} = \mathbb{C}$$
$$Cl_{0,2} = \mathbb{H} \text{ (quaternions)}$$
$$Cl_{0,3} = \mathbb{H} \oplus \mathbb{H}$$
$$Cl_{0,4} = M(2, \mathbb{H})$$
...
$Cl_{p,q}$ can be found from this table.

a) Find the Clifford algebra $Cl_{3,0}$ (Pauli algebra). It is known to be $M(2,\mathbb{C})$.

b) Find the Clifford algebra $Cl_{1,3}$ (Spacetime algebra). It is known to be $M(4,\mathbb{R})$ if we use a real representation, or $M(4,\mathbb{C})$ if we complexify. The standard Dirac algebra is $M(4,\mathbb{C})$.

c) What is the significance of the algebra being a matrix algebra $M(n, K)$?
   It means that the algebra can be represented by matrices, and that it has a minimal left ideal which is a vector space of dimension n over the field K. This minimal left ideal is the space of spinors.

d) From this, what is the dimension of spinors in 3D Euclidean space?

e) What is the dimension of spinors in 4D Minkowski spacetime?

### Solution 5

a) **Find the Clifford algebra $Cl_{3,0}$ (Pauli algebra).**

$Cl_{3,0}$ is isomorphic to $M(2, \mathbb{C})$, the algebra of 2×2 complex matrices. This is the Pauli algebra.

b) **Find the Clifford algebra $Cl_{1,3}$ (Spacetime algebra).**

$Cl_{1,3}$ is isomorphic to $M(4, \mathbb{R})$, the algebra of 4×4 real matrices. The complexified algebra is $M(4, \mathbb{C})$, which is the Dirac algebra.

c) **What is the significance of the algebra being a matrix algebra $M(n, K)$?**

It means that the algebra can be represented by matrices, and that it has a minimal left ideal which is a vector space of dimension n over the field K. This minimal left ideal is the space of spinors.

d) **From this, what is the dimension of spinors in 3D Euclidean space?**

For $Cl_{3,0} \cong M(2, \mathbb{C})$, the spinors are 2-dimensional complex vectors (Pauli spinors).

e) **What is the dimension of spinors in 4D Minkowski spacetime?**

For $Cl_{1,3} \cong M(4, \mathbb{R})$, the spinors are 4-dimensional real vectors (Majorana spinors). If we use the complexified algebra $M(4, \mathbb{C})$, the spinors are 4-dimensional complex vectors (Dirac spinors).
