# Example Problems: Projectors and Ideals

This lecture likely provides the algebraic tools needed to define spinors as minimal ideals.

## Problem 1: Projectors (Idempotents)

An projector (or idempotent) is an element 'p' of an algebra such that $p^2 = p$.
If p is a projector, then (1-p) is also a projector.
$p$ and $(1-p)$ are orthogonal projectors: $p(1-p) = (1-p)p = 0$.

a) In the algebra of 2x2 matrices, let $p = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. Verify that p is a projector.
b) Find the corresponding orthogonal projector, $q = 1-p$.
c) Any vector $v$ can be decomposed into a part in the subspace of p and a part in the subspace of q: $v = pv + qv$.
   Let $v = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$. Calculate $pv$ and $qv$ and show that they sum to $v$.

### Solution 1

a) **In the algebra of 2x2 matrices, let $p = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. Verify that p is a projector.**
$p^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = p$. It is a projector.

b) **Find the corresponding orthogonal projector, $q = 1-p$.**
$q = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

c) **Let $v = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$. Calculate $pv$ and $qv$ and show that they sum to $v$.**
$pv = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
$qv = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$.
$pv + qv = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} = v$.

## Problem 2: Ideals

A **left ideal** I in an algebra A is a vector subspace of A such that for any $x \in I$ and any $a \in A$, the product $ax$ is also in I.
A **right ideal** is defined similarly with $xa \in I$.
A **two-sided ideal** is both a left and a right ideal.

a) In the algebra of 2x2 matrices, $M(2, \mathbb{R})$, consider the set of matrices with the second column being zero:
   $I = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ c & 0 \end{pmatrix} \mid a, c \in \mathbb{R} \right\}$
   Show that this is a left ideal.
b) Is it a right ideal? (Hint: multiply an element of I by a general matrix from the right).
c) The set of all n x n matrices, $M(n, \mathbb{R})$, has only two two-sided ideals. What are they? (This is a property of "simple" algebras).

### Solution 2

a) **Show that this is a left ideal.**
Let $x = \begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ c & 0 \end{pmatrix} \in I$ and $A = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix}$ be a general matrix in $M(2, \mathbb{R})$.
$Ax = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ c & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} pa+qc & 0 \\ ra+sc & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
This is a matrix with the second column being zero, so it is in I. Thus, I is a left ideal.

b) **Is it a right ideal?**
$xA = \begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ c & 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} ap & aq \\ cp & cq \end{pmatrix}$.
This is not necessarily in I (the second column is not always zero). So it is not a right ideal.

c) **The set of all n x n matrices, $M(n, \mathbb{R})$, has only two two-sided ideals. What are they?**
The two two-sided ideals are the zero matrix {0} and the algebra itself, $M(n, \mathbb{R})$.

## Problem 3: Generating Ideals from Projectors

If 'p' is a projector, the set $I = Ap = \{ap \mid a \in A\}$ is a left ideal.
The set $J = pA = \{pa \mid a \in A\}$ is a right ideal.

a) Let A be the algebra of 2x2 matrices and $p = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
   Show that the left ideal $Ap$ is the set of matrices with the second column being zero (as in Problem 2a).
b) Describe the right ideal $pA$. What is the general form of a matrix in this ideal?
c) What is the intersection of these two ideals, $pAp$?

### Solution 3

a) **Show that the left ideal $Ap$ is the set of matrices with the second column being zero.**
Let $A = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix}$ and $p = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
$Ap = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\ r & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
This is the set of matrices with the second column being zero.

b) **Describe the right ideal $pA$.**
$pA = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
This is the set of matrices with the second row being zero.

c) **What is the intersection of these two ideals, $pAp$?**
$pAp = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} p & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
This is the set of matrices with only the top-left element being non-zero.

## Problem 4: Minimal Ideals

A non-zero left ideal I is **minimal** if the only left ideals contained within it are {0} and I itself.
In a matrix algebra $M(n, \mathbb{C})$, the minimal left ideals are the sets of matrices with all columns being zero except for one.

a) The left ideal from Problem 2a (matrices with zero second column) is a minimal left ideal of $M(2, \mathbb{R})$.
   What is the dimension of this ideal?
b) How many different minimal left ideals can you find in $M(2, \mathbb{R})$?
c) A projector 'p' is called **primitive** if it cannot be written as the sum of two orthogonal projectors.
   An ideal $Ap$ is minimal if and only if p is primitive.
   Is the projector $p = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ primitive?
d) Is the identity matrix $I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ primitive? What ideal does it generate?

### Solution 4

a) **What is the dimension of this ideal?**
The ideal is the set of matrices of the form $\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ c & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. This is a 2-dimensional vector space.

b) **How many different minimal left ideals can you find in $M(2, \mathbb{R})$?**
There are infinitely many, corresponding to different choices of projectors.

c) **Is the projector $p = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ primitive?**
Yes. It cannot be written as the sum of two orthogonal projectors.

d) **Is the identity matrix $I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ primitive? What ideal does it generate?**
No. $I = p + q$ where $p=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $q=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ are orthogonal projectors.
The ideal it generates is $AI = A$, which is the entire algebra.

## Problem 5: Application to Clifford Algebras

The definition of spinors as minimal left ideals of a Clifford algebra is a key concept.
Let's consider the Clifford algebra $Cl_{3,0}$ of 3D Euclidean space. This algebra is isomorphic to $M(2, \mathbb{C})$.
The generators are the Pauli matrices, $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3$.

a) The dimension of this algebra is $2^3=8$. The dimension of $M(2, \mathbb{C})$ is also 8 (since each of the 4 entries is a complex number, with 2 real numbers each).
b) A minimal left ideal in $M(2, \mathbb{C})$ has dimension 2 (as a complex vector space). This is the dimension of a Pauli spinor.
c) Let's construct a projector. Consider the element $p = \frac{1}{2}(I + \sigma_3)$. Show that this is a projector.
d) The spinor space can be defined as the ideal $S = Cl_{3,0} p$. 
   Let $\psi$ be a spinor in this ideal. Show that $\sigma_3 \psi = \psi$. 
   What does this mean physically? (The spinor is an eigenstate of the spin-z operator).
e) What ideal would be generated by the projector $q = \frac{1}{2}(I - \sigma_3)$?

### Solution 5

c) **Let's construct a projector. Consider the element $p = \frac{1}{2}(I + \sigma_3)$. Show that this is a projector.**
$p^2 = \frac{1}{4}(I + \sigma_3)(I + \sigma_3) = \frac{1}{4}(I^2 + 2\sigma_3 + \sigma_3^2) = \frac{1}{4}(I + 2\sigma_3 + I) = \frac{1}{2}(I + \sigma_3) = p$.
It is a projector.

d) **Let $\psi$ be a spinor in this ideal. Show that $\sigma_3 \psi = \psi$.**
If $\psi \in S = Cl_{3,0} p$, then $\psi$ is of the form $\psi = a p$ for some $a \in Cl_{3,0}$.
First, note that any element $\psi$ of the ideal $S$ is an eigenvector of the projector $p$ with eigenvalue 1. This is because $p \psi = p(ap) = a(p^2) = ap = \psi$.
Now, let's calculate the action of $\sigma_3$ on $\psi$.
First, observe that $\sigma_3 p = \sigma_3 \frac{1}{2}(I + \sigma_3) = \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_3 + \sigma_3^2) = \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_3 + I) = p$.
Therefore, $\sigma_3 \psi = \sigma_3 (p \psi) = (\sigma_3 p) \psi = p \psi = \psi$.
This means the spinor is an eigenstate of $\sigma_3$ with eigenvalue +1 (spin-up).

e) **What ideal would be generated by the projector $q = \frac{1}{2}(I - \sigma_3)$?**
This would generate the ideal of spin-down spinors, i.e., spinors $\psi$ such that $\sigma_3\psi = -\psi$.
