# Example Problems: Spinors as Minimal Ideals

This lecture explores a more abstract and powerful definition of spinors as elements of minimal left ideals of a Clifford algebra.

## Problem 1: Clifford Algebras

A Clifford algebra $Cl(V, q)$ is an algebra generated by a vector space V with a quadratic form q. The key relation is:
$vw + wv = 2q(v, w)$
where $q(v,w)$ is the symmetric bilinear form associated with q.

Let's consider the Clifford algebra of Euclidean 2D space, $Cl_{2,0}$. The vector space is spanned by {$e_1, e_2$} with the relations:
$e_1^2 = 1$, $e_2^2 = 1$, $e_1 e_2 + e_2 e_1 = 0$.

a) What is the dimension of this algebra? Find a basis for it.
   (Hint: The basis is {$1, e_1, e_2, e_1e_2$}).
b) Show that this algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of 2x2 real matrices, $M(2, \mathbb{R})$.
   (Hint: Find matrices that satisfy the same anti-commutation relations. Try the Pauli matrices, but be careful with the squares).
c) Now consider the Clifford algebra of Minkowski 2D space, $Cl_{1,1}$. The relations are:
   $e_1^2 = 1$, $e_2^2 = -1$, $e_1 e_2 + e_2 e_1 = 0$.
   Show that this algebra is also isomorphic to $M(2, \mathbb{R})$.

## Problem 2: Ideals and Projectors

An **ideal** I in an algebra A is a subspace such that for any $x \in I$ and any $a \in A$, the product $ax$ is in I (for a left ideal) or $xa$ is in I (for a right ideal).
A **minimal ideal** is a non-zero ideal that contains no other non-zero ideals.

An **idempotent** is an element $p$ such that $p^2=p$. Idempotents are projectors.
If $p$ is an idempotent, then the set $Ap$ (all elements of the form $ap$ for $a \in A$) is a left ideal.

a) In the algebra of 2x2 matrices, $M(2, \mathbb{R})$, consider the element $p = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. Show that it is an idempotent.
b) Describe the left ideal generated by this idempotent, $M(2, \mathbb{R})p$. What is the general form of a matrix in this ideal? What is its dimension?
c) Is this ideal minimal?

## Problem 3: Spinors as Ideals

A spinor can be defined as an element of a minimal left ideal of a Clifford algebra.
Let's work with $Cl_{1,3}$, the spacetime algebra. A common representation is by 4x4 complex matrices (the Dirac matrices). The algebra is $M(4, \mathbb{C})$.

a) The dimension of $M(4, \mathbb{C})$ is 16. A minimal left ideal in a matrix algebra $M(n, \mathbb{C})$ has dimension n.
   So, a minimal left ideal in our case has dimension 4. This is the dimension of a Dirac spinor.
b) Let's construct a projector. Let $\gamma_0$ be the time-like gamma matrix with $\gamma_0^2=I$.
   Consider the element $p = \frac{1}{2}(I + \gamma_0)$. Show that this is an idempotent.
c) The ideal generated by $p$ is $S = Cl_{1,3} p$. An element of this ideal (a spinor) is of the form $\psi = A p$ for some $A \in Cl_{1,3}$.
   Show that for any spinor $\psi$ in this ideal, $\gamma_0 \psi = \psi$.
   This means we have projected onto the +1 eigenspace of $\gamma_0$.

## Problem 4: The Spinor Space

The set of all spinors forms a vector space, called the spinor space S.
The Clifford algebra acts on this space by left multiplication.
If $\psi \in S$ and $A \in Cl_{1,3}$, then $A\psi$ is also in S.
This makes the spinor space a representation of the Clifford algebra.

a) Let's continue with the ideal $S = Cl_{1,3} p$ where $p = \frac{1}{2}(I + \gamma_0)$.
   An element $\psi \in S$ is a 4-component column vector.
   How does the algebra element $\gamma_1$ act on a general spinor $\psi$?
b) The Spin group is a subgroup of the Clifford algebra. How does an element of the Spin group (e.g., for a rotation) act on a spinor?
c) This shows that the ideal itself forms a representation space for the algebra and its subgroups.

## Problem 5: Equivalence of Definitions

How does this abstract definition of a spinor as an element of a minimal left ideal relate to the more common definition of "a quantity that transforms under the spin representation of the Lorentz group"?

a) The Spin group $Spin(1,3)$ is the double cover of the Lorentz group $SO^+(1,3)$. It is contained within the Clifford algebra $Cl_{1,3}$.
b) The action of the Spin group on the spinor space S (the minimal left ideal) *is* the spin representation.
c) So, an element of the ideal is precisely a quantity that transforms in the way we expect a spinor to transform.
d) What is the advantage of the ideal definition? It is more fundamental and does not require picking a specific matrix representation for the gamma matrices. The spinors are part of the algebraic structure itself. It provides a coordinate-free definition of spinors.

# Solutions to Example Problems: Spinors as Minimal Ideals

## Problem 1: Clifford Algebras

a) **What is the dimension of this algebra? Find a basis for it.**
The dimension is $2^2=4$. The basis is {$1, e_1, e_2, e_1e_2$}.

b) **Show that this algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of 2x2 real matrices, $M(2, \mathbb{R})$.**
Let $e_1 \to \sigma_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $e_2 \to \sigma_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$. This gives a valid representation.

c) **Now consider the Clifford algebra of Minkowski 2D space, $Cl_{1,1}$. Show that this algebra is also isomorphic to $M(2, \mathbb{R})$.**
Let $e_1 \to \sigma_1$ and $e_2 \to i\sigma_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. This gives a valid representation in $M(2, \mathbb{R})$.

## Problem 2: Ideals and Projectors

a) **In the algebra of 2x2 matrices, $M(2, \mathbb{R})$, consider the element $p = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. Show that it is an idempotent.**
$p^2 = p$. Yes, it is an idempotent.

b) **Describe the left ideal generated by this idempotent, $M(2, \mathbb{R})p$.**
It is the set of matrices with the second column being zero. The dimension is 2.

c) **Is this ideal minimal?**
Yes.

## Problem 3: Spinors as Ideals

b) **Let's construct a projector. Let $\gamma_0$ be the time-like gamma matrix with $\gamma_0^2=I$. Consider the element $p = \frac{1}{2}(I + \gamma_0)$. Show that this is an idempotent.**
$p^2 = \frac{1}{4}(I + 2\gamma_0 + \gamma_0^2) = \frac{1}{4}(2I + 2\gamma_0) = p$.

c) **Show that for any spinor $\psi$ in this ideal, $\gamma_0 \psi = \psi$.**
A spinor in the ideal satisfies $\psi = p\psi$. So $\gamma_0\psi = \gamma_0 p \psi = \gamma_0 \frac{1}{2}(I+\gamma_0)\psi = \frac{1}{2}(\gamma_0+I)\psi = p\psi = \psi$.

## Problem 4: The Spinor Space

a) **How does the algebra element $\gamma_1$ act on a general spinor $\psi$?**
It acts by left multiplication. The result $\gamma_1\psi$ is another spinor in the same ideal.

b) **How does an element of the Spin group act on a spinor?**
It acts by left multiplication.

## Problem 5: Equivalence of Definitions

d) **What is the advantage of the ideal definition?**
It is more fundamental and does not require picking a specific matrix representation for the gamma matrices. The spinors are part of the algebraic structure itself. It provides a coordinate-free definition of spinors.
