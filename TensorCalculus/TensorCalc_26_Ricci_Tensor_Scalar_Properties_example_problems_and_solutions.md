# Example Problems and Solutions: Ricci Tensor, Scalar Properties

## Einstein Tensor

The Einstein tensor is defined as $G_{ij} = R_{ij} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{ij}$.

### Problem 1
What is the significance of the Einstein tensor in General Relativity?

### Solution 1
The Einstein tensor $G_{ij}$ is the geometric part of the Einstein field equations. It is constructed from the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar in such a way that its covariant divergence is zero, which is necessary for consistency with the conservation of energy and momentum of the stress-energy tensor.

### Problem 2
Show that the covariant divergence of the Einstein tensor is zero: $\nabla^i G_{ij} = 0$.

### Solution 2
This is a consequence of the Bianchi identities for the Riemann tensor.

### Problem 3
Calculate the components of the Einstein tensor for a 2D flat plane.

### Solution 3
The Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar are zero, so the Einstein tensor is zero.

### Problem 4
Calculate the components of the Einstein tensor for the surface of a sphere of radius $R$.

### Solution 4
$R_{ij} = \frac{1}{R^2}g_{ij}$ and $R = \frac{2}{R^2}$. 
$$G_{ij} = R_{ij} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{ij} = \frac{1}{R^2}g_{ij} - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{R^2} g_{ij} = 0$$

## The Einstein Field Equations

The Einstein field equations are $G_{ij} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{ij}$, where $T_{ij}$ is the stress-energy tensor.

### Problem 5
What do the Einstein field equations describe?

### Solution 5
They describe how the distribution of matter and energy (represented by the stress-energy tensor $T_{ij}$) determines the curvature of spacetime (represented by the Einstein tensor $G_{ij}$).

### Problem 6
What does the stress-energy tensor $T_{ij}$ represent?

### Solution 6
It is a tensor that describes the density and flux of energy and momentum in spacetime. It is the source of the gravitational field.

### Problem 7
In a vacuum (where $T_{ij} = 0$), what do the Einstein field equations simplify to?

### Solution 7
They simplify to $G_{ij} = 0$, which is equivalent to $R_{ij} = 0$ (since $R$ will also be zero). These are the vacuum field equations.

## Properties of the Ricci Scalar

### Problem 8
How can the Ricci scalar be used to define an action for gravity (the Einstein-Hilbert action)?

### Solution 8
The Einstein-Hilbert action is $S = \int R \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x$. By applying the principle of least action to this action, one can derive the Einstein field equations.

### Problem 9
What is the variation of the Einstein-Hilbert action with respect to the metric?

### Solution 9
The variation of the Einstein-Hilbert action with respect to the inverse metric $g^{ij}$ yields the Einstein tensor $G_{ij}$.
