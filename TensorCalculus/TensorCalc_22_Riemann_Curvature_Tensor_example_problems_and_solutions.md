# Example Problems and Solutions: Riemann Curvature Tensor

## The Riemann Curvature Tensor

### Problem 1
What is the geometric meaning of the Riemann curvature tensor? What does it measure?

### Solution 1
The Riemann curvature tensor is the fundamental measure of the curvature of a manifold. It quantifies the extent to which the geometry of the manifold deviates from being flat. It captures the tidal forces and the path-dependence of parallel transport.

### Problem 2
The Riemann curvature tensor is defined by the equation $R(X, Y)Z = \nabla_X \nabla_Y Z - \nabla_Y \nabla_X Z - \nabla_{[X, Y]} Z$.
a) Explain what this equation means.
b) How does the Riemann tensor relate to the non-commutativity of covariant derivatives?

### Solution 2
a) **Explain what this equation means.**

This equation measures the non-commutativity of the covariant derivative. If the space were flat, the covariant derivatives would commute, and the Riemann tensor would be zero.

b) **How does the Riemann tensor relate to the non-commutativity of covariant derivatives?**

The Riemann tensor is precisely the operator that measures the failure of covariant derivatives to commute.

### Problem 3
What does it mean if the Riemann curvature tensor is zero everywhere on a manifold?

### Solution 3
If the Riemann curvature tensor is zero, the manifold is locally flat. This means that around any point, one can find a coordinate system in which the metric is the standard Euclidean metric and the Christoffel symbols are zero.

## Parallel Transport around a Loop

### Problem 4
Explain how the Riemann curvature tensor is related to the change in a vector when it is parallel transported around an infinitesimal closed loop.

### Solution 4
When a vector is parallel transported around an infinitesimal parallelogram spanned by vectors $X$ and $Y$, the change in the vector is given by $\Delta V = R(X, Y)V$.

### Problem 5
Consider a sphere. If you parallel transport a vector around a small loop, will it come back to its original orientation? What does this tell you about the curvature of the sphere?

### Solution 5
No, it will not come back to its original orientation. The change in the vector is a measure of the curvature enclosed by the loop. Since the sphere is curved, the vector will be rotated. This tells us that the Riemann curvature tensor of a sphere is non-zero.

## Symmetries of the Riemann Tensor

The Riemann tensor has several important symmetries. In component form $R^i_{jkl}$:

### Problem 6
1. $R^i_{jkl} = -R^i_{jlk}$
2. $R^i_{jkl} + R^i_{klj} + R^i_{ljk} = 0$ (First Bianchi Identity)
3. $R_{ijkl} = -R_{jikl}$
4. $R_{ijkl} = R_{klij}$

Explain the significance of these symmetries. How many independent components does the Riemann tensor have in n dimensions?

### Solution 6
1. **$R^i_{jkl} = -R^i_{jlk}$**: Antisymmetry in the last two indices.
2. **$R^i_{jkl} + R^i_{klj} + R^i_{ljk} = 0$ (First Bianchi Identity)**: Cyclic sum over the last three indices is zero.
3. **$R_{ijkl} = -R_{jikl}$**: Antisymmetry in the first two indices (after lowering the first index).
4. **$R_{ijkl} = R_{klij}$**: Symmetry of swapping the first and second pairs of indices.

These symmetries reduce the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor in $n$ dimensions from $n^4$ to $\frac{n^2(n^2-1)}{12}$.
